During the creation process, we used pretty simple method:

15 minutes of discussion about problem, that need to be solved.
2 houres of sprint with code.
15 minutes for review and sum up this part.
30 minutes for relax, and open mind.

Frameworks, that are inside project:

# Clicker - general information

> Fourth project - that's project, that im currently working on. The main idea is to create a simple JavaScript game, without using any outside engine, just raw code. 
> Right now the game is still not finished, and I guess the whole process will take much time, before leaving workbench. Short description about game - you're a new president ? > of area, that is absoulutely cut off from any society. You've to build a huge empire, using only clicking, and planing policy in menu.

**Pages**: [Link](hoopdead.github.io/portfolio/Clicker/)

**List of files** (html):

- index.html

Creation process, and work method:

Agile manifesto - planing, designing, programming, testing.

### Code review:

- function cashClick(number) - its pretty simple, this function have to count how much money you will get, after clicking dollar icon in game, and then Beautify the text, to natural number. F.e: from "183389.16666666" to "183,389$"

- function lemonBuy() - Function to buy a new lemon stand, first of all - check how much money player have, then add everything, beautify cash, count how much does player have to pay for next lemon stand, and jquery insert everything to HTML.

- function carBuy() - same, like above.

- function pizzaBuy() - same, like above.

- window.setInterval(function) - Add a small tax from every object, and save the game.

- function save() - insert values to localStorage.

- function load() - parse the values from local storages.

- function gameRestart() - set all values to default, and add special % to every object, so it's a lot easier to earn cash.

-function darkMode() - is still in progress, but in fact it's changing theme to night mode - so colors are adjust to tired eyes.

- function Beautify() - just a design thing, that makes numbers easier to read for player.

- function with particles - it's also a design feature - the little particle comes from clicked dollar icon, to upper text form.
